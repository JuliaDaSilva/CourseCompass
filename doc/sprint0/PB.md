2. Rachel is accesing the website to see if she can take an extra course for the summer. Since she is in her third year and already familiar with the courses at school, she can directly type the course code and go straight to the information page of that course.

3. Miguel is looking to see what courses he should take for his second year. Since he does not like to be presented with an overwhelming amount of information, he filters the list of courses to only show 2000 level courses which are relevant for his year of study.

4. Rachel wants to know if she meets the prerequisites for a summer course. She is already somewhat familiar with what the course is about so when looking at the course page she just wants to look at the prerequisites separate from other sections of the course page.

5. Emily is looking to get ahead and see if she is able to do a 2000 level course during her first year. She clicks on one of the 1000 level courses she is taking in the fall to see what upper level courses she can take by passing this course and clicking on them to go straight to those course pages.

6. Miguel is using the website to pick courses for his second year. Since he is looking through courses across multiple different subjects he wants to keep track of where he is on the website. The page he is on always displays his navigated path on the website, including links to the homepage, the subject he is on and the specific course he is currently viewing.

7. Rachel has decided on her summer course but wants to ensure that the subject is being taught by a good professor who will help her get a good grade. On the subject page she clicks a tab which shows all the professors who teach the subject ordered by their RateMyProf rating.

9. Miguel is looking to take some 2000 level math courses this year but wants to know which ones he is able to take without checking the prerequisites of each course individually.

Now the page color codes courses based on whether he meets all the requirements , missing some requirements or does not meet any of the requirements.

10. Emily decides that she wants to get ahead on completing her elective requirement so she decides to take a full year english course which is six credits. To make it easier she filters the subject page to only show courses which offer the same number of credits as requested.

11. Rachel decides to look at some other courses she may want to take in the summer. While looking at the information about one course she has some trouble reading the course description due to the font size being a bit too small. To make it more readable she clicks an icon next to the course description to increase the font size of that section only, without scaling all the other elements on the page.

12. When Miguel checks out one of the courses he is interested in, he struggles to comphrehend the course description. Due to the fact that his English is not fluent he is still unfamiliar with some of the words shown. To make it more readable he clicks on a dropdown menu at the corner of the page and selects his preferred language. The website gets refreshed with the text translated to the chosen language, allowing him to easily understand the course description.

13. Emily wants to find out the rating of a certain professor for one of her courses. Since she already knows the name of the professor, she goes to the homepage and clicks the tab which displays all the professors at the school. From there she types the name of the professor in a search box which will filter the list until she sees the professor she is looking for.

14. Rachel is looking to take an upper year biology course. Rather than clicking and viewing each course page individually, she reads the first line of the course description which is shown with each course. From there she finds a course that has piqued her interest and clicks on it to view more details about that course.

15. Rachel is using the website to search for courses, but after spending some time staring at the website her eyes become irritated by the brightness of the screen while reading the course details. She toggles the switch on the corner of the page which sets the website to dark mode, which darkens the background and puts less strain on her eyes.

16. Emily is considering between two different subjects to take an elective course from. To make it easier to compare them she selects both subjects on the homepage. When she clicks the search button it will show her a combined list of courses from both subjects, while keeping courses of the same subject grouped together.

17. Miguel is looking to take a second year engineering course. He does not remember the course code but he does remember the name of the course. At the top of the page he types in the name until he sees the course he wants at the top of the list.

18. Emily is looking at a 1000 level elective course to take for her first year. Since it is an elective, she does not care about what other courses she can take by passing it since she will not take another course from that subject. So on the course page she hides that section so she can only focus on the description and any other relevant information.

19. Due to Rachel's vision problems, she has a hard time looking at infromation that is cluttered and too closely grouped together. When she uses the website to search for courses she has an easy time distinguishing the different courses thanks to each course contained in a container vertically spaced far enough from other rows. The bold text also allows for better readability.

20. Miguel is looking at a 2000 level course to check both its prerequisites, as well as what 3000 level courses it serves as a prerequisite for. To better help him make a visula distinction between the two cases, the courses are grouped together and color coded.
