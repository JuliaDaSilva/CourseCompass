## Sprint Summary
Sprint 1 focused on creating the base of our project. Our two major goals going in, were our course search functionality and setting up prerequisite/post-requisite course linking. We managed to get everything done on time!

All planned user stories were completed and tested, and there were no unfinished tasks to carry over. The next sprint starts fresh with new user stories related to professor ratings and UI improvements.

---

## Practices We Want to Continue
- **Trello worked well** for tracking tasks and keeping things organized. Everyone used it throughout the sprint, and it helped us avoid overlap.
- **Standup meetings on discord and after class** helped us stay on track and made it easier to catch issues early.

---

## New Practices to Try
- **Using the shared Discord server more** instead of splitting conversations across personal chats. Some important info got lost or delayed when it was only discussed in small groups.
- **Adding labels and deadlines in Trello** to improve visibility on task priority and progress.

---

## Practices to Stop or Improve
- **Too many communication ourside of discord or private conversations** made it hard to keep everyone in the loop.
- **Late PR reviews** created some stress toward the end of the sprint. We’ll try to space reviews out better during Sprint 2.

## Reflections

**Best Experience:**  
Seeing the full search and prerequisite features working together at the end of the sprint felt like a big win. It made everything feel more real and gave us confidence for what's next.

**Worst Experience:**  
Early in the sprint, there was some confusion over who was doing what, mostly because of poor communication across platforms. We ended up duplicating work in one area and had to sort it out mid-sprint.

---

## Unfinished Tasks
None — all Sprint 1 stories were completed as planned. The new stories in Sprint 2 are part of the ongoing roadmap and not carry-overs.

---

## Looking Ahead
We’re happy with the progress we made and feel like we’ve built a solid base. Sprint 2 will introduce professor ratings and an improved design, but we’re heading into it with better tools and communication in place.
